## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
##trial
footballgames <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-02-04/games.csv')

broncosgames<-filter(footballgames, home_team == "Denver Broncos" | away_team == "Denver Broncos")

broncosgames %>%
  mutate(won = ifelse(winner == "Denver Broncos"), 1, 0) %>%
  group_by(`year`) %>%
  summarize(won = sum(won))
```
