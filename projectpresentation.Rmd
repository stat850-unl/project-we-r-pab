- The data was used as part of a Tidy Tuesday project, which is where we found the data
- The data has information about NFL games played from 2000-2019
- originally 19 variables in the data set
- 11 characters, 7 numeric, 1 time

## Data cleaning

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
##### derive categorical variable #####
# replace NA's in tie column with string 0
footballgames$tie[is.na(footballgames$tie)] <- "0"
# replace ties with string 1 instead of string with team name
for(i in 1:5324){
  if(footballgames$tie[i] != "0"){
    footballgames$tie[i] <- "1"
    i < i+1
  }
  else{
    i <- i+1
  }
}

# treat tie as categorical
footballgames$tie <- as.factor(footballgames$tie)


# get structure to check if tie is not a factor
str(footballgames)

# replace ties with string 1 instead of string with team name
for(i in 1:5324){
  if(footballgames$tie[i] == 1){
    footballgames$winner[i] <- "Tie"
    i < i+1
  }
  else{
    i <- i+1
  }
}
